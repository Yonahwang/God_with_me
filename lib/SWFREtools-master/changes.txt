Version 1.4 (September 5th 2011):

- Feature: SWF parser is now able to parse the RawABC tag
- Feature: Flash Dissector is now able to display code from RawABC tags
- Feature: Minimizer is now able to minimizer the RawABC tag
- Feature: Added a way to parse byte arrays as SWF files to make it easier
           to use the library from external projects.
- Bugfix: Fixed a bug that led to spontaneous exits of the parser and
          Flash Dissector.

Version 1.3 (June 19th 2011):

- Feature: It is now possible to dump the content of a SWF file to stdout by
           doing 'dissector.jar -dump <input file>'.
- Feature: It is now possible to decompress SWF files by doing
           'dissector.jar -decompress <input file> -o <output file>'.
- Feature: It is now possible to open files in SWF Dissector from the command
           line doing 'dissector.jar <file1> <file2> ... <filen>'.
- Feature: Function bodies defined by the ActionScript 2 functions
           DefineFunction and DefineFunction2 are now aligned better in the
	   GUI to improve readability of the code.
- Feature: Individual elements of a SWF file can now be dumped to a new file
           by right-clicking on the elements in the main tree of the GUI.
- Bugfix: Fixed a bug in the Minimizer that prevented it from working with
          compressed SWF files.

Version 1.2 (June 5th 2011):

- Feature: Made parsing of files more robust. This became necessary after the
           recent spike in obfuscated ActionScript code malware.
- Feature: Unknown ActionScript 2 instructions are now shown in the GUI with
           their action code.
- Feature: In ActionScript 2 code, the jump target of ActionIf instructions
           shown in the GUI is now the adjusted address instead of the raw
	   relative address. This makes it easier for the user to find out
	   where a jump is going.
- Feature: In ActionScript 2 code, the jump target of ActionJump instructions
           shown in the GUI is now the adjusted address instead of the raw
	   relative address. This makes it easier for the user to find out
	   where a jump is going.
- Feature: Strings defined in ActionScript 2 ConstantPool actions are now
           surrounded by quotes to make them more readable.
- Feature: When ActionScript 2 code is shown in the GUI, registers pushed
           by ActionPush are now easily distinguished from pushed integers.
- Feature: When ActionScript 2 code is shown in the GUI, constants pushed
           by ActionPush are now easily distinguished from pushed integers.
- Feature: When ActionScript 2 code is shown in the GUI, strings pushed
           by ActionPush are now easily distinguished from pushed integers.
- Bugfix: In previous versions, the ActionScript 2 actions belonging to a
          DoAction tag were not shown in the Flash Dissector tree. This has
	  been fixed.
- Bugfix: In previous versions, the ActionScript 2 actions belonging to a
          DoInitAction tag were not shown in the Flash Dissector tree. This has
	  been fixed.
- Bugfix: The constant list defined by an ActionScript 2 ConstantPool
          instruction is now better formatted for improved readability.
- Bugfix: ActionScript 2 Push instructions were previously not shown in the
          GUI.
- Bugfix: ActionScript 2 PushDuplicate instructions were previously not
          shown in the GUI.
- Bugfix: ActionScript 2 Pop instructions were previously not shown in the GUI.
- Bugfix: ActionScript 2 Play instructions were previously not shown in the GUI.
- Bugfix: ActionScript 2 PreviousFrame instructions were previously not shown
          in the GUI.
- Bugfix: ActionScript 2 RandomNumber instructions were previously not shown
          in the GUI.
- Bugfix: ActionScript 2 RemoveSprite instructions were previously not shown
          in the GUI.
- Bugfix: ActionScript 2 Return instructions were previously not shown
          in the GUI.

Version 1.1 (May 7th 2011):

- Feature: Much improved display of ActionScript 3 code
- Feature: Improved the Minimizer to give more status information
- Feature: Added a way to dump decompressed Flash files to disk from the GUI
- Feature: Opening SWF files via drag&drop is now possible in Flash Dissector
- Feature: Added source setup and installation information to the readme file
- Feature: Added the changes.txt file
- Bugfix: Fixed a bug in the Minimizer that led to nullpointer exceptions when
          the output results directory could not be determined
- Bugfix: Fixed a bug when parsing negative signed 3-byte integer values
